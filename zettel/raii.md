RAII stand for "Resource allocation is Initialization", and is a popular model for [[memory-management|managing memory]] in [[c-plus-plus|C++]]. The core concept here is that memory is allocated when constructing in a object, and deallocated (freed) when the object is destructed. This systematic approach of binding memory and object's lifetime will guarantee that no loose ends will be left when dealing with objects.
