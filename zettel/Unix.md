# Unix
Unix is an operating system developed by Bell Labs in the 70's as a successor of previous failed project Multics. It was written on the [[c]] programming language.

A series of operating systems derived from it are called Unix-like and they are standardised as Posix  compatible. [[linux]] and BSD are some examples of mother unix like operating systems. Some information about the system design can be found at [[the-unix-time-sharing-system]] while some more information about its history and development can be found at: [[The-Evolution-of-the-Unix-Time-sharing-System]]
