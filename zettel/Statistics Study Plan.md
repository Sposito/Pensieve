As a computer scientist, understanding statistics is essential for many fields, including machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here are some key areas of statistics that can be particularly helpful:

1.  Probability theory: Probability theory is the foundation of statistics, and it's important to have a solid understanding of probability distributions, random variables, and probability calculations.
    
2.  Statistical inference: This involves drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data, and it includes topics like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and estimation.
    
3.  Regression analysis: Regression analysis is a powerful tool for understanding relationships between variables, and it's particularly useful in machine learning and predictive modeling.
    
4.  Machine learning: Machine learning is a subset of statistics, and it involves using algorithms to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.
    
5.  Experimental design: This involves planning and conducting experiments to test hypotheses and collect data, and it's particularly important in fields like A/B testing and clinical trials.
    
6.  Data visualization: Visualizing data can be an effective way to communicate findings and insights, and it's important to understand how to create effective visualizations.
    
7.  Bayesian statistics: Bayesian statistics is a powerful approach to statistical inference that involves updating beliefs based on new data, and it's particularly useful in fields like artificial intelligence and decision making.
    

These are just a few of the key areas of statistics that can be particularly helpful for computer scientists. However, the specific areas you should focus on may depend on your specific field of interest and the problems you're trying to solve.

## Text Books

1.  Probability theory: "Introduction to Probability" by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang is a popular textbook for an introduction to probability. It covers a wide range of topics in probability theory, including discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem.
    
2.  Statistical inference: "Statistical Inference" by George Casella and Roger L. Berger is a classic textbook that provides a thorough introduction to statistical inference. It covers topics like estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals, as well as more advanced topics like multiple testing and Bayesian inference.
    
3.  Regression analysis: "Applied Linear Regression" by Sanford Weisberg is a practical guide to regression analysis that covers both simple and multiple regression. It also covers topics like diagnostic plots, model selection, and robust regression.
    
4.  Machine learning: "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman is a comprehensive textbook on machine learning that covers a wide range of topics, including linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.
    
5.  Experimental design: "Design and Analysis of Experiments" by Douglas C. Montgomery is a comprehensive textbook on experimental design that covers both basic and advanced topics. It includes chapters on completely randomized designs, randomized block designs, factorial designs, and response surface methods.
    
6.  Data visualization: "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by Edward Tufte is a classic book on data visualization that covers principles of effective visual communication and provides many examples of good and bad visualizations.
    
7.  Bayesian statistics: "Bayesian Data Analysis" by Andrew Gelman, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David B. Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald B. Rubin is a comprehensive textbook on Bayesian data analysis that covers both theory and practice. It includes chapters on hierarchical models, Bayesian model selection, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
