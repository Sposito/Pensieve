1. [ ]  "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition" by Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner (1998). This article describes the architecture and training algorithm of a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit recognition, which is considered a landmark paper in the field of deep learning.
    
2.  [ ] "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks" by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton (2012). This article describes the architecture and training algorithm of the AlexNet convolutional neural network, which won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge and marked the beginning of the deep learning revolution.
    
3.  [ ] "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Alex Graves, Ioannis Antonoglou, Daan Wierstra, and Martin Riedmiller (2013). This article describes the architecture and training algorithm of a deep reinforcement learning agent that can learn to play a variety of Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs.
    
4.  [ ] "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun (2016). This article introduces the residual network (ResNet) architecture, which enables the training of very deep neural networks by using skip connections to bypass multiple layers.
    
5.  [x] "Attention Is All You Need" by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin (2017). This article introduces the transformer architecture, which has become the state-of-the-art model for many natural language processing tasks.
