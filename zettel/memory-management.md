Memory can be managed differently in different computing models and programming languages. For higher level languages such as [[python]], [[JavaScript]] and [[Go]] this is usually done automatically for you, generally using a [[Garbage Collector]]. In some other languages where the programmer has more direct control memory can or must be managed manually, this is the case for [[c]], [[c-plus-plus|C++]] and [[rust]]
