# Pensieve
Here we will find a collection of thoughts of mine I believe are worth storing, relating and sharing. I am currently using [[Obsidian]] as the main form of editing and maintaining it, although it is all markdown text in the end so it is easy to migrate wherever I feel like moving in the future. I am somewhat following the [Zettel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) knowledge management.

I am currently (mid 2024) working on automation tools around it. As it is currently hosted on [GitHub](https:/github.com) those are mainly managed as actions, I will try to keep as much  of it as as scripts calls: so it can be easily ported later.
 
> A Pensieve is a wide and shallow dish made of metal or stone, often elaborately decorated or inlaid with precious stones, and carrying powerful and complex enchantments. Pensieves are rare, because only the most advanced wizards ever use them, and because the majority of wizardkind is afraid of doing so.
> 
> The perceived dangers of the Pensieve relate to its power over memory or thought. The Pensieve is enchanted to recreate memories so that they become re-liveable, taking every detail stored in the subconscious and recreating it faithfully, so that either the owner, or (and herein lies the danger) a second party, is able to enter the memories and move around within them. Inevitably, those with things to hide, those ashamed of their pasts, those eager to keep hold of their secrets, or protective of their privacy, will be wary of an object like the Pensieve.
