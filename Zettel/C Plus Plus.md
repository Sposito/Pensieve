##### C++
C++ is a [[Programming Languages|language]] created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 as an Object Oriented successor of the [[C]] programming language. It was intended as an extension of the C language with Classes and over the years evolved on its own thing still being mostly (but not exactly) a super set of the C language. It is mostly used in performance critical systems like video games, OS drivers and embedded devices.
