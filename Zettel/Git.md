## Conventional Commits
 [[#^ref1|"Conventional Commits"]] is a standardized format for writing commit messages, which helps make commit history more readable and automatable. The main descriptors are:

- **`feat:`** – Used when you are introducing a new feature.
- **`fix:`** – Used when fixing a bug.
- **`chore:`** – Used for small tasks or maintenance like refactoring or updating dependencies that don’t affect the code functionality.
- **`docs:`** – For changes or additions to documentation.
- **`refactor:`** – For restructuring existing code without changing its behavior.
- **`test:`** – When adding or modifying tests.
- **`style:`** – For formatting changes that don’t affect the code’s logic (e.g., whitespace, semicolons).
- **`perf:`** – For performance improvements.
