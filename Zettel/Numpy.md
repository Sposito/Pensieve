Numpy is a [[Python]]library used mainly for discrete maths and linear algebra.

Its main [[data-structure]] is the the multidimensional array object ([[ndarray]]).  Which gives origin to more complex objects like matrices. It also includes manipulation functions, such as linear algebra manipulations, sorting and statistical tools.
