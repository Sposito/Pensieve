Daily nutrient recommendations are based on the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) by age and gender. Nutrient recommendations based on the DRIs are meant to be applied to generally healthy people of a specific age and gender set. Individual nutrient requirements may be higher or lower than the DRIs. Consult a healthcare professional to determine individual nutrient requirements for those with specific health or medical conditions. [Learn more about the DRIs](https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-nutrient-reports)

When looking at results, keep in mind:

-   DRI amounts are set at levels to meet the nutrient requirements of almost all healthy people. Each reference value refers to **average daily nutrient intake**. Some deviation around this average value is expected over a number of days. In fact, nutrient amounts derived from day-to-day intake may vary substantially without ill effect. Access the [DRI Reports](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11537/dietary-reference-intakes-the-essential-guide-to-nutrient-requirements) for in-depth information on using the DRIs for planning and assessing dietary intake, as well as detailed reports on each of the nutrients.
-   Foods provide a variety of nutrients and other compounds that have healthful effects. Nutritional needs should be met primarily through eating a variety of foods as outlined in the [_Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025_](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf).
